### Who thought a goblin could be a tech expert?
_Goblin Intelligence Department / Taskforce Team Lead_

### Hey, so what do we have here?
- `r3-package` [ **PUBLIC** ] : Some hacky-tools for your average script kiddie. Always use with consent... Don't be a bad boy.
- `smart-goblin` [ **PUBLIC** ] : Light, small, and fast PHP framework. What else do you need?
- `goblin-labz` [ **PRIVATE** ] : Did you really think I would make this repo public? [Visit site](https://goblinlabz.org)
- `time-lords` [ **PRIVATE** ] : CRM site for a larp event. [Visit site](https://timelordsrev.org)
- `s3kr3ts` [ **SUPER-PRIVATE** ] : Kind of a r3-package but more dangerous, way more dangerous. I don't even feel it would be ethical to make this repo public. If you are interested to check it out, hit me.

### That's all?
Yes. This is not IKEA, move along thank you.
